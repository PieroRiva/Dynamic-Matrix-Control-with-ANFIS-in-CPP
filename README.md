# Dynamic-Matrix-Control-with-ANFIS-in-CPP

This script uses a trained 4 input NARX ANFIS (from matlab code in my other scripts) for the 6DOF dynamic model of a low scale blimp in the model based predictive control strategy Dynamic Matrix Control. It is actually written in C++ but it was programmed in a .cu extension for speed comparison purposes with a CUDA implementation.
